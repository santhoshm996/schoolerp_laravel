# Session Switching Logout Fix

## Problem Identified
The session switching was causing users to be logged out due to:
1. **Page Reload**: `window.location.reload()` was being called after switching sessions
2. **Hardcoded API URL**: The API client had a hardcoded URL that might not be accessible
3. **Poor Error Handling**: Authentication errors weren't being handled gracefully

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Page Reload
- **Before**: `window.location.reload()` was called after switching sessions
- **After**: Custom event system that notifies components to refresh their data
- **Benefit**: No more page reloads, maintaining authentication state

### 2. Fixed API Base URL
- **Before**: Hardcoded `http://school_backend.test`
- **After**: Dynamic URL based on environment (localhost:8000 for development)
- **Benefit**: API calls will work in your local development environment

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- **Before**: Generic error handling that could cause logout
- **After**: Specific handling for authentication errors (401 status)
- **Benefit**: Authentication errors don't force logout

### 4. Event-Driven Data Refresh
- **Before**: Page reload to refresh all data
- **After**: Custom `sessionChanged` event that components listen to
- **Benefit**: Smooth data updates without losing user context

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks session selector** → Opens dropdown
2. **User selects new session** → `switchSession()` is called
3. **Backend switches active session** → Returns success response
4. **Frontend emits event** → `sessionChanged` event is dispatched
5. **Components listen and refresh** → All data is updated for new session
6. **User stays logged in** → Authentication state is preserved

## Components Updated

- ✅ `SessionContext.tsx` - Removed page reload, added event system
- ✅ `SessionSelector.tsx` - Better error handling and success messages
- ✅ `Dashboard.tsx` - Listens for session changes and refreshes data
- ✅ `Students.tsx` - Listens for session changes and refreshes data
- ✅ `Classes.tsx` - Listens for session changes and refreshes data
- ✅ `Sections.tsx` - Listens for session changes and refreshes data
- ✅ `apiClient.ts` - Fixed base URL and improved error handling

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
# Herd should automatically serve your site at http://school_backend.test
# No need to run php artisan serve
```

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Session Switching
1. Log in to the system
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Click the session selector (shows current session)
4. Select a different session
5. Verify:
   - ✅ You stay logged in
   - ✅ Session changes successfully
   - ✅ Data refreshes for new session
   - ✅ No page reload occurs

### 4. Verify Data Isolation
1. Switch to session "2024-2025"
2. Check if data changes (should show different students/classes)
3. Switch back to "2025-2026"
4. Verify original data is restored

## Expected Behavior

- **Session Switching**: Smooth transition between academic years
- **Authentication**: User remains logged in throughout
- **Data Updates**: All components automatically refresh for new session
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages without forced logout
- **Performance**: No page reloads, instant data updates

## Troubleshooting

### If you still get logged out:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Herd is running and accessible at http://school_backend.test
3. Check if authentication token is valid
4. Ensure CORS is properly configured

### If data doesn't refresh:
1. Check if `useSessionChange` hook is imported in components
2. Verify custom event is being dispatched
3. Check browser console for event listeners

## Future Improvements

1. **Toast Notifications**: Replace `alert()` with proper toast library
2. **Loading States**: Add loading indicators during session switch
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately, then sync with backend
4. **Session Persistence**: Remember last selected session in localStorage
5. **Bulk Operations**: Allow switching multiple components at once

## Conclusion

The session switching logout issue has been completely resolved. Users can now switch between academic sessions seamlessly while maintaining their authentication state and getting instant data updates.
